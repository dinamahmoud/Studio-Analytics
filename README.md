Studio Analytics
======================

In a creative work environment, many invisible factors are at play. Factors which are seemingly trivial and insignificant, such as movement patterns, light intensities, occupancy shifts, and temperature fluctuations among many.
By collecting  and mapping some of this data, patterns can start to emerge that define the physycal space as well as the habits of the people in it.
Using discreet sensors, our system will un-intrusively collect this data which can be visualized and used to connect spaces across the globe, as well as to convey the character of the studio to its sister studios and the general public. This transparency will facilitate collaboration as well as aid in coming up with solutions to a more efficient working environment.

Based on the critiques, it makes the most sense to go with the Vibe proposal. We hadn't considered the idea of counting to be so problematic, and I don't thing the reviewers really bought the notion that reductively simple mechanisms would be better.
The only problem I see going forward is the one that Nicolla mentioned regaring noise levels in the space due to traffic, especially at rush hour. I only hope we can set the grid to the correct dimensions so that we can really get a thorough profile of the different sound levels within the space.
