Studio Analytics
======================

In a creative work environment, many invisible factors are at play. Factors which are seemingly trivial and insignificant, such as movement patterns, light intensities, occupancy shifts, and temperature fluctuations among many.
By collecting  and mapping some of this data, patterns can start to emerge that define the physycal space as well as the habits of the people in it.
Using discreet sensors, our system will un-intrusively collect this data which can be visualized and used to connect spaces across the globe, as well as to convey the character of the studio to its sister studios and the general public. This transparency will facilitate collaboration as well as aid in coming up with solutions to a more efficient working environment.
